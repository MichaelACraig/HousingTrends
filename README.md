Predictive Analysis Project on the Price of Homes in Brevard County, Florida in the next 10 years

1. Data Collection - What data do I need to collect?
    - Create APIs and collect data from general and local Housing Marketplaces (Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, Redfin)
        - These websites also carry market data, so account for those as well

    - Create APIs and collect data for Market data for Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), The Federal Reserve, an Financial News Websites
        - Need data on GDP Growth, unemployment rates, inflation rates, mortgage rates, and consumer confidence.

    - Collect US Census Bureau Data for factors such as Population growth, household income, age distribution and migration patterns.

    - Collect Data from Housing Data Research firms, real estate websites, and industry reports to get factors of housing inventory, new construction rates, housing affordaiblity indices, and housing market sentiment.

    - Check local government websites, urban planning departments,or regional economic developmental organizations to collect data on local factors that may impact housing prices, like zoning regulations, development projects, transportation infrastructure plans, or changes in local amenities.

2. Feature Selection - What data collected is important?
    - Identify features that might influence home prices (interest rates, population growth, employment rates, median income, etc.) 

3. Data Preprocessing
    - Clean the data and remove missing values, inconsistencies, or outliers.

4. Exploratory Analysis - What is correlated?
    - Gain insights into the relationships between different variables and home prices (i.e home prices and population, prices and mortgage rates, etc.)

5. Model Selection - How should the data be processed?
    - Choose an appropriate predictive modeling technique based on the data and objective (i.e Linear regression, decision trees, random forests, NNs, etc.)

6. Feature Engineering - How can I refine my process?
    - Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model

7. Training
    - Split data into training and validation sets. Train model on the training data and tune the hyperparameters to optimize performance

8. Evaluation - What insights have we come to?
    - Evaluate the performance of your model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared (RÂ²) coefficient of determination.

9. Validation and Testing
    - Validate the model's performance on validation set and fine-tune as necessary.

10. Forecast
    - Use the trained model to make predictions on future home prices for the next 10 years.

11. Risk Assessment
    - Assess the uncertainty and risks associated with your predictions by conducting sensitivity analysis or deploying probablistic forecasting techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations
